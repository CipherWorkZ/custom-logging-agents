# custom-logging-agents

A collection of lightweight Python agents and systemd services for **custom log collection** and forwarding to **Graylog**.  

Each agent runs independently and is designed to monitor or tail a specific application/service, enrich logs with structured JSON (and tracking IDs when useful), and ship them directly into your logging pipeline.

## ðŸ“‘ Table of Contents

1. [FFmpeg Agent](./ffmpeg)  
   - Tracks active FFmpeg transcode processes  
   - Reports CPU, RAM, I/O, and network usage  
   - Assigns tracking IDs (TIDs) per process  
   - Generates per-session summaries when jobs complete  

2. [Nginx Proxy Manager Agent](./nginx-reverse-proxy)  
   - Tails NPM access/error logs in real time  
   - Streams live log lines into Graylog  
   - Creates tracking IDs (TIDs) for ongoing issues until resolved
